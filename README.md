# DeathRoadV2
A 2d version of the Death Road thru DMF!

Regrettably, not as far fleshed out as I would have liked but most items are here, including a bonus item.
Play the Death Road thru DMF and turn all the homework in to get the most expensive degree ever!
When opening the game there is a player (the student) and several professors spawn. 
They will threaten to shoot their UDP cannons at the student (although regrettably they are not capable of movement at this time). Touching them damages the player.
The student must catapault his homework at all of the professors. They will go away after 1 hit and award 100 points. After all professors have been cleared, the final boss appears
and requires 2 homeworks to satisfy, and beat the game, for 200 points.
Running low on lives after contacting the professors too much? Shoot at the gold coins that appear all over the map to help increase your score (50 points per gold coin pickup).
Every 3 gold coin pickup events will generate a new life for the player.
At the end of the game, your score is displayed and saved to the database 

Missing walls/multiple levels
Enemies can't move or shoot on thier own

Player can earn up to 2 extra lives completing the gold coin side quests.
